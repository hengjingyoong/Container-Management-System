                    Operating in 100 countries and transporting goods around the globe, at first glance it would appear Danish shipping
                    company Maersk Line is already handling all the cargo it can manage. But when Maersk determined that the volume of most
                    of the goods it was shipping had grown to full capacity, the company decided that cloud powered solutions would be a
                    crucial part of rectifying the situation.
